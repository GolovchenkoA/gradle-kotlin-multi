    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)
    // In mathematics, an INVARIANT is a property of a mathematical object (or a class of mathematical objects) which
    // REMAINS UNCHANGED !!!!! after operations or transformations of a certain type are applied to the objects

//    A generic class—for instance, MutableList—is called invariant on the type parameter if, for any two different
//    types A and B, MutableList<A> isn’t a subtype or a supertype of MutableList<B>. In Java, all classes are invariant
//    (even though specific uses of those classes can be marked as non-invariant, as you’ll see soon).
